// 1. Write code to allow visitors of the page to customize it to their liking. There is a
// form on the page that accepts a name (to be used in a greeting when the user visits
// the page) and a color picker to allow the user to choose their preferred background
// color/foreground color combination. Write the necessary code to capture these values
// when the form is submitted (prevent the default action on the form submission button to
// achieve this) and store these values in localStorage (so that it persists on the userâ€™s
// computer and their preferences are saved indefinitely). Next, write a function to apply
// the preferences if they have been set and call it each time the page loads. You may
// also want to call this function again when the user saves their preferences to
// immediately apply them. Make sure you also notify the user somehow that the preferences
// were saved.

document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', () => {
    const form = document.getElementById('preferences-form'); // assigns preferences-form to the constant variable form
    const notification = document.getElementById('submit'); // assigns the ID submit to constant variable notification
    const greeting = document.getElementById('greeting');// assigns the ID greeting to constant variable greeting
